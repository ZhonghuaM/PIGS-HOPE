# PIGS-HOPE
Satellite-derived NH3 estimates of Pigs in Spain: a tale of ambition, overconfidence and hope


‚ú® Overview

This repository contains a fully reproducible workflow that:
	‚Ä¢	converts IASI NH‚ÇÉ satellite columns to mass,
	‚Ä¢	derives monthly dry & wet deposition with ERA5 drivers and a bidirectional flux formulation,
	‚Ä¢	calculates fractional-area-weighted totals for all 18 Natura-2000 bog reserves in Spain using supersampled raster masks, and
	‚Ä¢	writes tidy CSV + NetCDF tables ready for analysis or policy reporting.

The project grew out of the 2025 FONDA Summer-School exercises and follows widely-accepted README structure recommendations



üóÉÔ∏è Outputs
	‚Ä¢	Maps ‚Äì PNG quick-looks in fig_dry/, fig_wet/, fig_total/.
	‚Ä¢	Gridded NetCDF ‚Äì monthly and yearly deposition fields.
	‚Ä¢	Reserve tables ‚Äì kg NH‚ÇÉ per bog per month, suitable for
trend plots or cumulative budgeting.
